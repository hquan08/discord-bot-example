# discord-bot-example
A simple discord bot using Javascript &amp; some JS libraries to display data.
To program the discord bot, you will first need to install the Discord bot library: https://discord.js.org/ <br/>
I use some api websites, which are random joke to get a joke and meme-api to get a random meme post from subreddits.

Random Joke api: https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke

Reddit meme post api: https://meme-api.herokuapp.com/gimme/<!---[put_your_subreddit_name_here_to_get_a_post]---> (i.e endpoint should be /gimme/memes)

Note:
The Random joke api is created by 15Dkatz (check out his github: https://github.com/15Dkatz) <br/>
The reddit meme api is created by D3vd (check out his github: https://github.com/D3vd) <br/>
Also, you will need to login to discord developer to be able to create a new project, which will have an option to create a new bot for your own work plus a bot token
to make it work in the code.<br/>
# Run the bot
Install a library called nodemon and in package.json, add a new line under the "scripts" called "devStart":"nodemon".In the terminal command, type npm run devStart to run the bot. It will automatically restart and compile and run the bot whenever you make a change in your code. <br/><br/>
I am learning JS so it won't be perfect as it seems but I will try to improve myself!<br/>
It's my first time using Github so feel free to help me with this and feel free to comment/edit on my file :)! thanks
